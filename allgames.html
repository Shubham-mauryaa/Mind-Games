            <p class="lead">2048 is a game where you combine numbered tiles in order to gain a higher numbered tile.The rules are also simple. You just need to move the tiles and every time you move one, another tile pops up in a random manner anywhere in the box. When two tiles with the same number on them collide with one another as you move them, they will merge into one tile with the sum of the numbers written on them initially.</p>

Using a single ball, the player must knock down as many bricks as possible by using the walls and/or the paddle below to hit the ball against the bricks and eliminate them. If the player's paddle misses the ball's rebound, they will lose a turn.</p>

            <p class="lead">Hangman is a quick and easy game for at least two people that requires nothing more than paper, a pencil, and the ability to spell. One player, the "host," makes up a secret word, while the other player tries to guess the word by asking what letters it contains. However, every wrong guess brings them one step closer to losing. Hangman can also be customized to make the game easier, harder, or educational, and there are apps and websites to play online if you would like. </p>

              <p class="lead">Hextris is a simple reincarnation of Tetris in hexagon form. Meaning that colored lines will fall from six sides towards a central hexagon, and you need to rotate the hexagon to get the colors to match. When you eventually can't keep up, and the hexagon fills with colored lines, the game is over.</p>

              <p class="lead">Tic Tac Toe is traditionally played on a 3 x 3 grid. Players take turns placing a mark in one of the cells of the grid. The goal of the game is for players to position their marks so that they make a continuous line of three cells vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. An opponent can prevent a win by blocking the completion of the opponent's line. In our variant of the game, players placed objects on a board. In order to induce participants to produce utterances that were usable for analysis, participants had their own playing boards and faced away from each other, so that verbal communication was required. </p>
