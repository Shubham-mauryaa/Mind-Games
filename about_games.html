                <h2>About Our Website</h2>
    
                <p><em>"MindGames"</em> is an online gaming website where<em>people can have fun while learning some puzzle and improving themselves.</em></p>
    
                <p>Studies have shown that certain games can help younger children improve early reading skills with the support of parents and teachers. Games like 'Times Table Rock Stars' that is used in primary schools and pre-school apps like 'Endless Alphabet' can be great tools to help children learn in a more engaging way. Also, with the growth of connected toys, children can experience physical play while playing on devices. Educational toys like Osmo combines tactile play pieces with a device's camera to bring to the in-play action to life.</p>

            <p><b>Enhances memory, brain's speed, and concentration</b></p>
            
            <p>Games that are immersive and require strategy and problem-solving skills to win, require players to remember and take in a lot of information. Regularly playing these types of games can help improve childrenâ€™s short and long-term memory and help the brain process information quicker.</p>
    
            <p>Also, games capture players' imagination helping them to stay focused on certain tasks and builds their perseverance to achieve a goal.</p>

            <h3>Improved multi-tasking skills</h3>
            
            <p>Games that require players to find items while fighting off other opponents call for attention to detail and quick reactions. Studies have shown that playing these types of games can help children develop their multi-tasking skills.</p>
            
            <h3>Build skills for future careers</h3>
            
            <p>The more complex multiplayer games help teach players how to be strategic, analytical to assess risk and reward and call for them to react quickly to changes in the game. All these skills that they use can be transferable to real-world jobs that rely on problem-solving, analytical skills and strategic thinking.</p>
            
            <p>Offer a new way to understand culture and perspectives
                As games allow children to immerse themselves in virtual worlds and at times connect to people from around the world, it can be a great way for them to learn about different perspectives and cultures.</p>

            <h3>Promotes teamwork and builds confidence</h3>
            
            <p>Multiplayer games allow children to take on a number of roles that allow them to learn how to manage a team if they are the leader or negotiate ways to win as part of a group. The shared experience can be a great way to collaborate and learn from each other to build children confidence.</p>
            
            <h4>Provide a way to develop compassion</h4>
            
            <p>There are a number of games and apps that have been developed to help children manage their emotions and encourage kind behaviour, compassion, and empathy. See our list of wellbeing apps to learn more.</p>
